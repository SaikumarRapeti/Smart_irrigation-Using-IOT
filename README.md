# Smart_irrigation-Using-IOT
Smart irrigation using iot low power consumption
Hi I made this project with my group in 3rd Year Semester-1

Abstract :

Agriculture plays the major role in economics and survival of people in India. Nowadays Indian agriculture faces a major problem due shortage of water.
And wastage of water is also a major concern. In order to overcome this problem we have to use water more efficiently.
We are trying to achieve this with our project
The main aim of this project is to design low cost Automated Irrigation System using a Wireless Sensor Network.
The Purpose of this project is to provide iot based system for irrigation to reduce the manual monitoring of the field and get the information to the user using wireless module. 
The development of this project at experimental scale within a single plant is presented and the implementation was to demonstrate that the automatic irrigation can be used to reduce water use.
